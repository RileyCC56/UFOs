# Overview:
The following webpage is a user-friendly output that provides a filtered table that will display results that vary on the usersâ€™ criteria. Our webpage has been formatted as the user can enter their desired specifications and only the following data will show. The data will show results of date, city, state, viewing duration, and shape of UFO sightings.

# Webpage:

# Results:

As we have gathered the following data that shows UFO sightings the user now has the option to filter by date, city, state, country, shape, and viewing duration. With adding these filters each user can pinpoint what results they wish to see in a quick and easy way. The webpage will also only display the results that are within the database. If the user adds a date, city, or state that does not match the criteria then no results will display.

As explained above the following results show a filtered result by date and state. Please see the following results below.

The user than can further break down the result by including a city and our will results will be displayed as shown below.

# Summary:

The following webpage does filter or information in a quick and orderly manner for the desired visitor but I believe being able to quickly navigate through the webpage does not grab the interest for longer than 10 seconds on our webpage. Due to our filter system I believe we can keep users interest on the webpage by adding a resource display as well as a interactive map.

By possibly including further references such as videos, pictures, interviews, and news clippings that would further provide a visual guide of proof for the user I believe the user would extend their duration on our webpage.

Also adding a map that displays North America that has a plotting coordinate attached with the UFO sighting information could provide the user with an exciting and different way of visualizing the gathered data. If users had the chance to zoom in to each sighting with such ease as google maps it could draw further interest and maybe expand other conclusions and theories.
